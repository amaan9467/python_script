# python_script

task 1 explanation ---
Takes two numbers as input from the user.
Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Handles division by zero to avoid runtime errors.
Displays the results of all operations.


task 2 explanation ---

Asks the user for their first and last name.
Combines both into a full name with a space in between.
Displays a greeting message using the full name.

task_1_cs explaination --

The program takes an integer input from the user.
It checks if the number is divisible by 2 (num % 2 == 0).
If true, it prints that the number is even; otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.

task_2_cs explaination --

This program iterates from 1 to 50, adds each number to the total_sum variable, and finally prints the result.

func_mod_1 explaination --

Takes a number as input from the user and performs three mathematical operations using the math module: calculating the square root, natural logarithm (log base e), and sine (in radians). It then displays the calculated results using f-strings. If the user inputs a negative number, the program may throw a math domain error for the square root and logarithm functions since they are undefined for negative values. This program demonstrates the use of Pythonâ€™s built-in math module for performing common mathematical computations.


func_mod_2 explaination --

It defines a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number. It takes user input and calls the function, which multiplies the number by the factorial of the previous number until it reaches the base case of 1. If the input is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 immediately. The factorial function is a fundamental concept in programming, often used in mathematical computations, permutations, and probability calculations.
